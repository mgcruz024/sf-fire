Database Creation workflow

* in a real-world situation, there will be different database environments. Since we're starting from scratch, we have the 
perfect oppurtunity to mirror how orgs structure their db servers.

Types:

	dev - here is where you build and test connections/schema
	test - create the schemas that will be used in prod and validate everything here 
	prod - for production ready tables 
	
* Isolating envs. has multiple benefits

	1. Prevents test data from affecting end-users
	2. Lets you use the test as a disaster backup/rollback strategy 
	3. Lets you simulate prod behavior safely 
	4. Helps detect issues before going live 
	
Steps for creating db server envs.

	1. Build and test on dev env 
	2. Push code to git/staging env 
	3. Migrate schema and data to test 
	4. Run final QA 
	5. Promote to prod 
	
* Large orgs have multiple servers for the same project; let's mimic this by creating 
a server for each purpose within the development cycle 
	
	1. Makes for easier auditing 
	2. Safe isolation of code and data by lifecycle stage 
	3. Supports CI/CD, migration tools, and ETL 
	
	
We'll start with the development server 
	
	Purpose - experimentation, testing local features, and QA automation 
	Access - developers only 
	Databases:
		sf_fire_dev: Daily development and testing 
		sf_fire_qa: Manual/automated QA 
		(optional) sf_fire_ci: Continuous integration DB if using automated test runners 
		
		
Datasets

	1. Fire incidents and 911 calls 
		: the initial load should be historical, but after that, only grab trailing three weeks.
		
	2. Census from Open Data 
		: use zcta to join onto dimNeighborhood zip code
